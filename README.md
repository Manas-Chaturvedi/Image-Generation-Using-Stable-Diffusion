# Image-Generation-Using-Stable-Diffusion
#This project uses the Stable Diffusion model, a text-to-image AI model, to generate images from user-provided text prompts. First, it installs necessary libraries like torch, diffusers, transformers, and accelerate. Then, it imports these libraries, initializes the Stable Diffusion pipeline, and moves it to the GPU for faster processing. Finally, it takes a text prompt from the user, uses the pipeline to generate an image based on the prompt, and displays the generated image using matplotlib. In essence, this project allows users to create images from text descriptions using a powerful AI model within Google Colab.
